# Classical-Classification-Methods (KNN-SVM-DecisionTree-RandomForest-GradientTreeBoosting)

In this repo, I've used Iris Dataset (from sklearn library) to learn basic machine learning algorithms. Following classification algorithm has been tested against the dataset:

1. KNN (K- Nearest Neighbor) Classification Method
2. SVM (Support Vector Machine) Classification Method
3. Tree Based Classifiers (Decision Tree, Random Forest & Gradient Tree Boosting)

Detailed explanation and analysis of each method along with some extra important questions related to these classical algorithms has been provided in the classifier code files and 
under "Extra Imp. Q&A" directory.
